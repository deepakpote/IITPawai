            The Maharashtra In-service Teacher Resource Application and web portal is the first of its kind
            initiative by the Maharashtra Academic Authority to provide teachers across the state with access
            to quality teaching and learning resources that are contextualized and relevant to their needs.
            Many of these resources have been created by teachers themselves. Teachers can also find useful videos
            for their self-learning which they can access at their convenience on their smartphones and in the true
            sense get teacher education on demand.
            MITRA aims to enable all teachers in the state to have a direct channel of communication with the M.A.A.
